## Introduction  
A s4u-styled clock with weather information using GEC6818.  
This project rely on [Simple weather backend](https://github.com/LTLAE/Simple-Weather-Back-end), in Getweather method (a independent exec file).  
Also check [S4U: CITYPUNK 2011 AND LOVE PUNCH](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612700/S4U_CITYPUNK_2011_AND_LOVE_PUNCH/). The best game of 2025 for me.
